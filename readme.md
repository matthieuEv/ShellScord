# ShellScord

ShellScord is a Discord Client in your shell written in python powered by [Textual](https://github.com/Textualize/textual).

> [!CAUTION]
> Discord is trademark of Discord Inc. and solely mentioned for the sake of descriptivity. Mention of it does not imply any affiliation with or endorsement by Discord Inc.
> 
> Client modifications are **against Discord‚Äôs Terms of Service**.
>
> However, Discord is pretty indifferent about them and there are no known cases of users getting banned for using client mods! So generally you should be fine as long as you don't misuse ShellScord. But no worries, ShellScord is safe to use!
>
> Regardless, if your account is very important to you and it getting disabled would be a disaster for you, you should probably not use any client mods, just to be safe
>
> Additionally, make sure not to post screenshots with ShellScord in a server where you might get banned for it
